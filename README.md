# comment_recognizer

Python script that reads the input from a text file named ‘input.txt’ including a string of characters and generates a text file named ‘output.txt’ containing either a ‘yes’ (i.e., indicating that the input string is a valid comment), or a ‘no’ (i.e., for invalid comments) with a short error message. Comments are valid if they start with a ‘/_’ end with ‘_/’, and can contain any character strings except for ‘\*/’ unless it is surrounded by two double quote characters(").
